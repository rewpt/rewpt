### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Zev, and I am a full-stack developer living in Toronto, Canada. I love learning about modern technologies and using them to find better ways to solve problems.
Check out my latest project, Catchlight, a social media platform where you can log reviews and chat about movies with your friends!
